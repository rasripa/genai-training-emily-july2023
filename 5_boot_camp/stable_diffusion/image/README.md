# Image build for Stable Diffusion
This sample notebook shows you how to build a custom Docker image for Stable Diffusion, both training and hosting. You'll need to run this in a compute environment supported by Docker, notably not SageMaker Studio. If you like, you can run this in SageMaker notebook instances.

Alternatively, you can simply use a pre-built version of this that I'm hosting for you. It's listed in the lab directly.
