# 3-day boot camp: distributed training and hosting on AWS
In this 3-day boot camp, your business and technical teams will collaborate to gain hands-on experience with various aspects of the entire AI/ML lifecycle. 

### Scope
While starter code will be provided, **you will need to develop the solutions yourself.** Said another way, we'll provide the mentorship and expertise, you provide the muscle to bring it to life.

### Projects
You'll break into teams and focus on one of 3 projects: text/image with Stable Diffuion, text-only with GPT, and 3D vision with autonomous vehicles.

### Milestones
Each day you and your team will need to hit a new milestone. 
1. First, you'll download your data, configure it with FSx for Lustre, and connect it to SageMaker Training.
2. Second, you'll experiment with training the model on SageMaker using multiple GPUs and instances.
3. Finally, you'll host your model on SageMaker and learn about prompt engineering and MLOps best practices to optimize performance.

### The business pitch
For each team, you'll want to bring at least one business stakeholder to participate throughout the bootcamp. They will primarily help make the business case for this model, identifying clear revenue targets the model could achieve based on current business volumes today, and using this to solve for an anticipated total compute cost.
